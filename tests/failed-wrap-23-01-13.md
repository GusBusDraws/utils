## Notebooks
Progression of notebooks used throughout this project. NBs 00-03 are the fruitless exploration of applying the elliptical Hough transformation. NBs 04-05 are for extracting the nine frames from the single image. NB 06 is a simple and rough detection method that doesn't work for image [Al-3Si-3.tif](Al-3Si-3.tif).
